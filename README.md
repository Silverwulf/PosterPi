# PosterPi
Downloads the Movie or TV show poster of whatever is playing on a given Plex server and displays it on an Inky Impression E-Ink screen.

Once the repo has been claimed rename config-sample.ini as "config.ini" and input the Ip address and port number for where your Plex server is located. You will also need to insert the file path for the images you want displayed once the Plex Server isn't playing anything.
